# Python Modules, Random, Lists & Loop Practice

This repository contains Python programs and notebook examples designed to build strong fundamentals in **Python programming**.
It focuses on **modules**, the built-in **random** library, **lists**, **loops**, **range**, and several **logic-based mini projects and games**.

These exercises are ideal for beginners who want hands-on practice with core Python concepts and interactive console programs.

## Topics Covered

### Python Modules

* What a module is
* Creating a custom module (`my_module.py`)
* Importing modules
* Accessing variables from modules

**Example**

* Using `pi` from a custom module to calculate the area of a circle

---

### Random Module

* `random.randint(a, b)`
* `random.random()`
* Scaling random floats
* `random.seed()` for reproducible results
* Random choice from a list

**Examples**

* Coin toss simulator
* Love score generator
* Banker roulette
* Password generator

---

### Python Lists

* Creating lists
* Accessing elements
* Modifying values
* Adding and removing items
* List slicing
* Looping through lists
* Finding maximum values manually
* Extending lists
* Random selection from lists

---

### Loops (for loop)

* Iterating through lists
* Performing operations on each element
* Counting items manually
* Calculating totals and averages

**Example**

```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print("I like " + fruit)
```

---

### String to List Conversion

* Using `split()`
* Splitting by spaces
* Splitting by commas
* Converting string inputs to integers

---

### Range Function

* `range(start, stop)`
* `range(start, stop, step)`
* Using range in loops
* Summing numbers with range

---

## Mini Projects & Practice Programs

### Area of a Circle (Module Example)

* Uses a custom module containing `pi`
* Calculates the area of a circle using imported values

---

### Coin Toss Simulator

* Uses `random.seed()`
* Outputs Heads or Tails

---

### Banker Roulette

* Randomly selects who pays the bill
* Uses comma-separated user input

---

### Treasure Island Grid Game

* Uses a 3×3 matrix
* Places treasure based on user input

---

### Rock Paper Scissors Game

* ASCII art display
* User vs computer
* Determines win, lose, or draw

---

### Pizza Billing Program

* Size-based pricing
* Pepperoni and cheese add-ons
* Calculates the final bill

---

### Student Height Average Calculator

* Takes user input
* Calculates total height
* Counts number of students
* Computes average height without built-in functions

---

### Highest Score Finder

* Finds the highest score from a list
* Uses loops instead of `max()`

---

### Sum of Numbers (1–100)

* Uses `range()`
* Demonstrates accumulation logic

---

### PyPassword Generator

* Generates a secure random password
* User chooses:

  * Number of letters
  * Number of symbols
  * Number of numbers
* Password is shuffled for unpredictability

---

## How to Run the Programs

### Run Python Files

1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Python-Modules-Random-Lists
   ```
3. Run a program:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

---

### Run Jupyter Notebook

1. Install Jupyter (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebook and run cells step by step

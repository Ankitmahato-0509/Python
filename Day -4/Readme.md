# Python Modules, Random Library, Lists & Mini Projects

This folder contains Python programs demonstrating how to use **modules**, the built-in **random** library, **list operations**, and several logic-based mini projects and games.

The goal is to strengthen understanding of importing modules, working with collections, randomness, and building interactive console programs.

---

## Topics Covered

### Python Modules

* What a module is
* Creating a custom module (`my_module.py`)
* Importing modules
* Accessing variables from modules

Example:

* Using `pi` from `my_module` to calculate the area of a circle.

---

### Random Module

* `random.randint(a, b)`
* `random.random()`
* Scaling random floats
* `random.seed()` for reproducible results
* Coin toss simulation
* Love score generator

---

### Python Lists

* Creating lists
* Accessing elements
* Modifying values
* Adding and removing items
* List slicing
* Looping through lists
* Finding the largest number
* Extending lists
* Random choice from a list

---

### String to List Conversion

* Using `split()`
* Splitting by spaces
* Splitting by commas

---

## Mini Projects & Games

### Area of a Circle (Module Example)

* Uses a custom module containing `pi`
* Calculates circle area using imported value

---

### Coin Toss Simulator

* Uses random seed
* Outputs Heads or Tails

---

### Banker Roulette

* Randomly selects who pays the bill
* Uses comma-separated input

---

### Treasure Island Grid Game

* Uses a 3×3 matrix
* Places treasure based on user input

---

### Rock Paper Scissors Game

* ASCII art display
* User vs computer
* Determines win, lose, or tie

---

### Pizza Billing Program

* Size-based pricing
* Pepperoni and cheese add-ons
* Calculates final bill correctly

---

## How to Run the Programs

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to this folder:

```
cd Python-Modules-Random-Lists
```

3. Run the Python file:

```
python filename.py
```

---

## Learning Objectives

This practice focuses on:

* Understanding Python modules and imports
* Using built-in libraries
* Working with lists effectively
* Applying randomness in programs
* Writing interactive console games
* Improving logical thinking
* Creating small real-world simulations

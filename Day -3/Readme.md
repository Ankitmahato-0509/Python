# Python Control Flow Statements & Practice Programs

This folder contains Python programs demonstrating **control flow statements**, which determine the order in which instructions are executed.
It includes conditional statements, loops, flow modifiers, and several mini projects based on real-world scenarios.

---

## Topics Covered

### Conditional Statements

* `if`
* `elif`
* `else`
* Nested `if-else`

Examples include:

* Voting eligibility
* Grade calculation
* Pass/fail system
* ATM menu system
* Height and age checks

---

### Loops

* `for` loop
* `while` loop

Used to:

* Print sequences
* Repeat tasks
* Iterate with counters

---

### Control Flow Modifiers

* `break` – exits a loop early
* `continue` – skips the current iteration
* `pass` – placeholder for future code

---

## Practice Programs & Mini Projects

### Odd or Even Checker

* Takes a number as input
* Determines whether it is odd or even

---

### Nested If-Else Examples

* Reappear exam option
* ATM transaction menu
* Roller coaster eligibility & ticket pricing

---

### BMI Calculator

* Takes height and weight
* Calculates BMI
* Categorizes into:

  * Underweight
  * Normal
  * Overweight
  * Obese
  * Clinically obese

---

### Leap Year Checker

* Uses logical conditions:

  * Divisible by 4
  * Divisible by 100
  * Divisible by 400

---

### Roller Coaster Billing System

* Height eligibility
* Age-based ticket pricing
* Optional photo charge
* Calculates total bill

---

### Pizza Billing Program

* Size selection (S, M, L)
* Pepperoni add-on pricing
* Extra cheese option
* Displays final bill
* Includes corrected version of logic

---

## How to Run the Programs

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to this folder:

```
cd Control-Flow-Python
```

3. Run the Python file:

```
python filename.py
```

## Learning Objectives

This practice focuses on:

* Understanding decision-making in Python
* Writing nested conditions
* Using loops effectively
* Applying `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
* Building logic for real-life problems
* Strengthening problem-solving skills
